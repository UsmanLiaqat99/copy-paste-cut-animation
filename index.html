        Don't Forget To Follow Usman Liaqat <br /><br />
        Somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me // I ain't the sharpest
        tool in the shed // She was looking kind of dumb with her finger and her
        thumb // In the shape of an "L" on her forehead
        <br /><br />
        Well the years start coming and they don't stop coming // Fed to the
        rules and I hit the ground running // Didn't make sense not to live for
        fun // Your brain gits smart but your head gits dumb // So much to do,
        so much to see // So what's wrong with taking the back streets? //
        You'll never know if you don't go // You'll never shine if you don't
        glow
        <br /><br />
        Hey now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play // Hey now,
        you're a rock star, get the show on, get paid // And all that glitters
        is gold // Only shooting stars break the mold
      </p>
